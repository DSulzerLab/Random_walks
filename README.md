# Random_walks
Random walks and Schmitz/Sulzer modified random walks for simulations of electrochemical detection of neurotransmitter release and reuptake.

For a tutorial that explains random walks and how to design a random walk spreadsheet, read 
Chapter 1 introduction to using spreadsheets to simulate random walks

To learn how to integrate Michealis-Menten kinetics (Km and Vmax) for uptake transporters in a random walk (Schmitz/Sulzer model) read

To use the model, we have prepared the following instructions and Excel spreadsheets. First, download Chapter 3 and follow the advice.
Chapter 3. Using the spreadsheets

To download the Microsoft Excel spreadsheets designed to simulate amperometry or cyclic votammetry in the acute slice, download the corresponding files in this repository:

Excel files

Random walk model for amperometry (.xls file)

Random walk model for cyclic voltammetry (.xls file)

(new as of January 2006) amperometry spread sheet with flux through a pore model (.xls file)

binhex files

Random walk model for amperometry (binhex)

Random walk model for cyclic voltammetry (binhex)

the binhex files require "unstuffing". The program "Expander" can be downloaded from http://www.aladdinsys.com/downloads/index.html
